### What is this?
My personal website made with Vue.js. Previously I had done this with Bootstrap, but this time I wanted to challenge myself to implement a responsive site using just CSS. IMO it makes the code a lot cleaner due to not needing as many nested HTML elements. Will try to update it as much as I can with projects :).

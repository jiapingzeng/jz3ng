### What is this?
My personal website. Previously I had done this with Bootstrap and jQuery with a simple Express server, but this time I wanted to challenge myself to try a more modern approach (with Vue.js) with as few other libraries as possible. IMO eliminating Bootstrap makes the code a lot cleaner due to not needing as many nested HTML elements. Will try to update the site as much as possible with my projects :).
